# Here is a cheat-sheet for this file as of MySQL 4.0.14
# 2003-12-18 - tony_clayton@mitel.com
#
# 1. The mysqld binary reads options from the [mysqld] section,
#    and then overrides those values with any passed-in
#    arguments.
#
# 2. The mysqld_safe script reads options from the following
#    sections in order, overriding any previous values with newer
#    ones:
#       [mysqld] [server] [mysqld_safe] [safe_mysqld]
#    It then overrides those values with any passed-in
#    arguments, and invokes the mysqld binary (see #1 above) with
#    the resulting argument list.  
#
#    * The server and safe_mysqld sections are deprecated in
#      favour of mysqld and mysqld_safe respectively.
#
# 3. The mysql or mysqld initscript reads options from the
#    following sections in order, overriding any previous values
#    with newer ones:
#       [mysqld] [mysql_server] [mysql.server]
#    It then overrides those values with any passed-in arguments,
#    and invokes the mysqld_safe script (see #2 above) with the
#    resulting argument list.
#
#    * The SMEServer doesn't have any need for initscript-only
#      options, so we don't use mysql_server and mysql.server
#      sections.
